Tired of the confusing Infinite Campus grades UI and having to manually calculate the lowest grade you can get on an assignment?

Worry no longer! This handy extension aims to address 2 crucial oversights of Infinite Campus, a confusing UI and the inability to simulate your grade.

With this extension, the assignments for each class are sorted neatly by grading category with your current grade and category grades at the top of the page. Additionally, you can see how assignments will affect your grade by changing your score for past assignments, adding new assignments, or deleting past assignments! You will also be able to view a graph showing how your grade has been changing throughout the semester.
